  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Paneer Butter Masala is one of India’s most popular paneer gravy recipe. This recipe with Indian cottage cheese cubes in a creamy tomato sauce is one that I have been making for a long time.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Cashews</li>
    <li>Cream</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Paneer</li>
    <li>Spices & Herbs</li>
    <li>Ripe red juicy tomatoes</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li> Soak 18 to 20 cashews in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>When the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients like chopping tomatoes, chopping and preparing the ginger-garlic paste, slicing paneer etc.</li>
    <li> Crush 1-inch ginger + 3 to 4 medium-sized garlic to a paste in a mortar pestle to a semi-fine or fine paste. Keep aside. Don’t add any water while crushing ginger & garlic</li>
    <li> After 20 to 30 minutes, drain the water and add the soaked cashews in a blender or mixer-grinder. Also, add 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh water or as required</li>
    <li>Blend to a smooth paste without any tiny bits or chunks of cashews. Remove the cashew paste in a bowl and set aside.</li>
    <li>In the same blender add 2 cups of diced or roughly chopped tomatoes. No need to blanch the tomatoes before blending.</li>
    <li>Blend to a smooth tomato puree. Set aside. Don’t add any water while blending the tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Keep the flame to a low. Add 1 medium-sized tej patta (Indian bay leaf). Fry for 2 to 3 seconds or till the oil becomes fragrant from the aroma of the tej patta</li>
    <li>Add the prepared crushed ginger-garlic or 1 teaspoon ready ginger-garlic paste.</li>
    <li>Fry for some seconds till the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic disappears</li>
    <li>Pour the prepared tomato puree. Be careful while adding the puree as it may splutter</li>
    <li>Mix it very well with the butter.</li>
    <li>Begin to cook the tomato puree on a low to medium-low flame. Stir at intervals</li>
    <li>The tomato puree mixture will start simmering</li>
    <li> In case the tomato puree splutters too much while cooking then cover the pan partly with a lid or cover fully with a splatter lid (channi lid). the tomato puree might splutter if there is more water content in the tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Do stir at intervals</li>
    <li>Simmer the puree for 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
    <li>Then add 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder or deghi mirch. You can even add ½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder or ¼ to ½ teaspoon of cayenne pepper or paprika or any other variety of red chilli powder</li>
    <li>Mix well and continue to stir and sauté the tomato puree</li>
    <li>Sauté till the butter starts leaving the sides of the pan and the entire tomato puree mixture comes together as a whole.

      This entire cooking and sautéing of the tomato puree take about 14 to 17 minutes on a low flame to medium-low flame.
      
      Time will vary depending on the thickness of the pan, size, the intensity of flame etc.</li>
    <li>Now add the prepared cashew paste.</li>
    <li>. Mix the cashew paste very well with the cooked tomato puree and continue to stir and sauté on a low to medium-low flame. Stir non-stop after adding cashew paste.</li>
  </ol>
